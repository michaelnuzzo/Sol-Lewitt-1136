## Overview

The Sol Lewitt 1136 app is a digital recreation of Sol Lewitt's <em>Wall Drawing 1136</em> that allows the user to "paint" their own version to an infinite canvas. For reference, the "original" can be found at the [Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/artist-rooms-sol-lewitt-wall-drawing-1136-2004).

## Install

The app can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://github.com/michaelnuzzo/Sol-Lewitt-1136/releases) in this repository. You may need to authorize the app to be run on your machine in "System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Allow apps downloaded from".

## Build

The Sol Lewitt 1136 app was built in openFrameworks. You should be able to build the .app by creating a new openFrameworks project and installing the files in the src/ directory.
